# Honey-Hole

The Honey-Hole project is being created for the purpose of managing data collected from
honey pots deployed throughout an organization.


## Honey-Hole Project Planning

What are we going to do and how are we going to do it?


### Data Collection

We could configure our honey pots to send data to a location in the Honey-Hole root directory.

    /opt/honey-hole/data/honey-pot-x
    /opt/honey-hole/data/honey-pot-y
    /opt/honey-hole/data/honey-pot-z

We can use a config file to set metadata for each honey pot.
